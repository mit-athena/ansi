.SH NAME
ansi, unseg \- read and convert VMS ansi labeled tapes.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ansi
[ \fB-bfisv\fP ] [ \fRdrive\fP ] [ files ] ...
.LP
.B unseg 
< file > newfile
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIAnsi\fP is used to read and convert files from ansi labeled tapes.
In particular, it handles gracefully the following situations:
(1) non-standard block sizes,
(2) variable length records, both text and binary data
(binary data is converted to f77 style variable records),
(3) extraction of particular files from the tape,
(4) version numbers of files,
(5) fortran carriage control text files,
(6) fixed length record binary files.
In particular, it is useful for reading labeled tapes produced by
Vax/VMS.
All \fIfiles\fP
listed in the argument are extracted into the current directory.
If no files are specified, all files on the tape are extracted.
.PP
The companion program \fIunseg\fP
is useful for converting VMS fortran variable length segmented files
(the default file type produced by VMS fortran) to a form readable directly
by the Unix fortran compiler.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose mode.
\fIAnsi\fP
will give a running commentary of the files created and the types
determined from the HDR1 and HDR2 labels.
.TP
.B \-s
Superverbose mode.
Dumps all useful contents of the HDR1 and HDR2 records on the standard output.
This is useful for debugging purposes.
.TP
.B \-b
Force binary input of all data in the file.
No record interpretation is performed.
.TP
.B \-f
Read the tape on device \fIdrive\fP rather than \fI/dev/rmt8\fP.
.TP
.B \-i
Ignore version numbers.  No version numbers will be appended to the file
names.
.TP
.B \-l
List all file names and types on the tape.  This prevents any files from being
extracted.
.LP
\fIUnseg\fP gives up the ghost if presented with a file in a format it can't 
understand.
.SH WARNING
\fIAnsi\fP will destroy any file in the current directory of the same name
of a file extracted from tape.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP
Can't open \fIfile\fP
\fIAnsi\fP could not open the tape drive for reading.
.TP
Error in reading volume label.
The label on the tape was bad.
.TP
Volume label found was XXXXXX.
The volume label on the tape was XXXXXX.
.TP
Creating file \fIfile\fP, file type is ....
verbose information commentary.
.TP
Can't Create \fIfile\fP, skipping file on tape.
\fIAnsi\fP could not create the file in the current directory,
probably because there was already a file of that name that was not writeable.
.TP
Bad HDR2 record!
Tape is probably not an ansi tape.
.TP
ansi: bad forms, binary assumed in \fIfile\fP.
The forms control character was not A, M or space.
All \fIansi\fP can do is read in the data as binary,
as it has no way to find out how to format the data.
.TP
ansi: unknown type, binary assumed in \fIfile\fP.
Fixed format files should always have internal forms control;
something else was detected.
.TP
ansi: unknown format, binary assumed in \fIfile\fP.
The format of the tape was neither fixed or variable,
the only forms that \fIansi\fP understands.
.TP
Record wrong size (count = XXXXX)
The block size on tape does not match the block size recorded in the
file header.

.SH BUGS
Should do more sanity checking on tape files.
.LP
There is no way to automatically unsegment fortran files as they come in;
VMS fortran does its own segmentation on input and output and does not tell
RMS.
.LP
Should be tested with against other Ansi tapes written on other than VMS.
.LP
VMS is obsolete and should be abolished.
.LP
Fortran carriage control conversion is not perfect.  Then again,
neither is fortran.
