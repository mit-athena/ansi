	variable length records. 					*/

/*	a fortran "segmented" file is a sequence of variable length records
	with a two byte header on each record used to encode information to
	allow fortran writes and reads to span multiple records of data.
	See the VMS fortran User's Guide for details.
	This header can have four values, documented below:
		0 - this is in the middle of the record
		1 - this is the beginning of a record
		2 - this is the end of a record
		3 - this is the entire record.
